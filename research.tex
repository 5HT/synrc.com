\paragraph{}
    On the entry level of problem analysis we emphasise the stage of
    assessment the area of possible ways to solve you problem, or a
    set of technique that can be used in your project. Followed reports
    of that findings includes all business, economical, technical weights
    and activities that can be used by people who is responsible for
    decision making. For sure we provide with analysis our appraisal
    for decision motivation.

\section*{Expertise}

\paragraph{}
After initial state of gathering information of the problem data domain
    and building the space of concurrent ways of delivered project problem
    the conclusion can be extended with expertise, can covers economical
    marks, further vision of evolution and management of risk connected
    with particular decision on the solution.

\section*{Prototyping}
%HEVEA \begin{divstyle}{block}
\paragraph{}
On the way of getting research phase done, after assumption of the
    project plan one of the possible next steps is to implement
    the prototype to provide the prove of concept. That limited
    functionality project is the best demo application to the business plan.
    However in real life often happens that project was deployed witthout
    research or even planning phase. Thus the real-time reengineering
    took most of the resources. Our intention is to defend complex
    projects from such mistakes and to provide full-process cycle for
    customers.

\section*{Research Outsourcing}
\paragraph{}
We are focusing on research outsourcing. We provide external research
    services for companies which has no dedicated research team needed for
    their projects. As a rule companies with medium number of employers in
    need of research phase in some project allocate research resources for
    projects needs among current staff of corresponding specialists. Only
    big companies has dedicated research laboratories that can provide full
    problem analysis from planing phase to proof of concept presentation.
\paragraph{}
We offer full cycle of research analysis in wide range and kinds of
    complex systems areas. For you company our research center provide
    submission &mdash; an research department that can be integrated in your
    business processes in many ways. We support most of process templates
    from entry-level processes (for medium companies) to CMMI certified
    conduct of an affair (for large-scale companies).
\section*{Process Integration}
\paragraph{}
When Company decides to deliver project development to external solution supplier it can do at any stage of research phase. In fact IT companies that submission project of applications and systems developing gets the tasks bypassing the research development. However to produce mature solutions on the market there is need more deeply analysis of ways to implement. From other side often companies deliver development process to companies with much closer data domain knowledge.
\paragraph{}
We provide better research support to your projects. We know that there is a kind of projects that can't start implementing without deep investigation and how difficult to find appropriate persons with science oriented approach. Thus for companies that find us near their sphere of areas we can provide full cycle of analysis with easily integration to demand existed business processes. Relying on strong team of our researchers and set of our division and data domain laboratories we hope you find long time partners with our research center.
