\section*{N2O: Elements}

\subsection*{Page construction}
With N2O you usually don't use HTML at all. Instead you define you page
in the form of Erlang records and thus page is typed and checked at compilation time.
This is a classical CGI approach for compiled pages and it gives us benefits like
compilation-time error-checking and great server-side rendering.

\subsection*{Control Elements}
Nitrogen elements by their nature are control elements primitives
that you use for Nitrogen page constructon in Erlang-based DSL Langugae.
They are rendered into HTML and JavaScript.
All behavior of elements are controlled on server side and all communications
between browser and server are done via WebSocket channels.
So no POST requests and HTML forms are used.

\subsection*{Static Elements: HTML}
The core set of HTML elements includes br, headings, links, tables, lists and image.
Static elements will be transfored into HTML during rendering.
\paragraph{}
Also static elements could be used as placeholders for other HTML elements.
Usually ``static'' means elements that don't use postback parameter:

%HEVEA \rawhtmlinput{templates/static-elements.htx}

\subsection*{Active Elements: HTML and JavaScript}
There are also form elements which provide some information for the server
and gather user input:  button, radio and check buttons, text box area and password box.
Form elements usually allow to assign some Erlang postback handler to specify action behavior.
Such elements are tranformed into HTML and JavaScript. I.e. during rendering some
Actions are converted into JavaScript and sent to and executed in the Browser.

%HEVEA \rawhtmlinput{templates/active-elements.htx}

When postback action is specified the page module should include a callback which will handle that postback info:

%HEVEA \rawhtmlinput{templates/active-elements-postback.htx}

You specify in element definition the list of {\bf source} elements that provide data to event callback.

\subsection*{Creating Your own Elements}
