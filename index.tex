\section*{We offer Erlang for Web}
\paragraph{}
Our success would be impossible without the support of widely accepted tools for the Erlang/OTP platform.
Due to the existence of RabbbitMQ, GProc, Riak, ejabberd, exmpp, Nitrogen and
Cowboy we were able to deliver state of the art solutions to our customers. 
Our secret is beneath the way of what we are using and how.
